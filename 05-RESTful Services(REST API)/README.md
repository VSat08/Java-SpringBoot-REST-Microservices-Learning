## Introduction

Welcome to **02 - Building RESTful APIs** ðŸŒŸ! Here, weâ€™ll harness Spring Boot to craft RESTful web servicesâ€”key to modern app communication. This roadmap takes you through REST principles, endpoint creation, and client interaction, all in a beginner-friendly way. Letâ€™s build APIs that talk to the world! ðŸš€

## 1. What Are RESTful APIs?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

RESTful APIs are web services following REST (Representational State Transfer) principles.

- **Definition**: Stateless services using HTTP for data exchange (e.g., JSON, XML).
- **Purpose**: Enable communication between clients (e.g., browsers) and servers.

#### Real-World Analogy

Think of RESTful APIs as a waiterâ€”taking your order (request) to the kitchen (server) and bringing back food (response).

### 1.2 Why RESTful APIs Matter

- **Interoperability**: Connects diverse systems.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale apps.
- **Simplicity**: Uses standard HTTP methods.

#### Example Benefit

Fetch a list of books from a library app with a single `/books` request.

### 1.3 Key Terms for Beginners

| Term              | Meaning                                      | Example                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **REST**          | Architectural style for APIs                 | Stateless requests          |
| **Endpoint**      | URL to access a service                      | `/api/books`                |
| **HTTP Methods**  | Actions like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE          | `GET /books`                |
| **JSON**          | Lightweight data format                      | `{"title": "Java"}`         |
| **Postman**       | Tool to test APIs                            | Send GET request            |

## 2. Learning Roadmap

### 2.1 Understanding RESTful Services

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: REST principles and best practices.
- **Goal**: Define what makes a service RESTful.

### 2.2 Creating a Simple RESTful API

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: Writing services and exposing endpoints in Spring Boot.
- **Goal**: Build a functional API.

### 2.3 HTTP Methods

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: Using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Goal**: Handle different request types.

### 2.4 Using Postman

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: Testing APIs with Postman.
- **Goal**: Verify endpoints work as expected.

### 2.5 JSON and XML Binding

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: Converting Java objects to JSON/XML and back.
- **Goal**: Master data exchange formats.

## 3. What Youâ€™ll Build

Youâ€™ll create a RESTful API with endpoints like:
- `GET /api/books` - List all books.
- `POST /api/books` - Add a book (JSON input).
- Tested via Postman with JSON responses.

>[!TIP]
>Start smallâ€”your first endpoint is a win!
