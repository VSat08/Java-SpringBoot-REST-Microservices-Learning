# 08 - Spring Security

## Introduction

Welcome to **08 - Spring Security**!

In this section, weâ€™ll dive into securing your Spring Boot applications using **Spring Security**. Whether you're building REST APIs or web applications, security is a critical aspect of modern software development. Weâ€™ll explore how to protect your endpoints, manage user roles, and store credentials securely. By the end of this section, youâ€™ll be able to implement authentication and authorization in your Spring Boot applications like a pro. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸ”’

## 1. What Is Spring Security?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

Spring Security is a powerful framework for securing Spring-based applications. It provides comprehensive security features, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like CSRF and session fixation.

- **Definition**: Spring Security is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and other security features for Java applications.
- **Purpose**: It ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources in your application.
- **How**: It uses servlet filters to intercept requests and enforce security rules.

#### Real-World Analogy

Think of Spring Security as a bouncer at a club. It checks your ID (authentication) and ensures you have the right access (authorization) before letting you in.

### 1.2 Why Spring Security Matters

- **Protection**: Secures your application from unauthorized access and common attacks.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple authentication mechanisms (in-memory, database, LDAP, OAuth, etc.).
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Spring Boot and other Spring projects.
- **Customizability**: Allows you to define custom security rules and configurations.

#### Example Benefit

With Spring Security, you can easily restrict access to specific endpoints based on user roles, such as allowing only admins to delete records.

### 1.3 Key Concepts: Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., username and password).
- **Authorization**: Determines what a user is allowed to do (e.g., access specific resources).

#### Example

- **Authentication**: A user logs in with their credentials.
- **Authorization**: The user is allowed to view their profile but not edit othersâ€™ profiles.

### 1.4 Spring Security Architecture

Spring Security uses **servlet filters** to intercept and process web requests. These filters handle authentication and authorization before the request reaches your controllers.

- **Servlet Filters**: Pre-process and post-process web requests.
- **Security Filters**: Apply security logic (e.g., check credentials, enforce roles).
- **Configuration**: Defined in `application.properties` or custom security configuration classes.

#### Flow of Action

1. A request is made to a protected resource.
2. Spring Security filters intercept the request.
3. The filters check if the user is authenticated and authorized.
4. If successful, the request is routed to the resource; otherwise, access is denied.

## 2. Learning Roadmap

Your path to mastering Spring Security over the next 4-5 sessions!

### 2.1 Securing REST APIs

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: How to secure REST endpoints using Spring Security.
- **Goal**: Protect your APIs from unauthorized access.

### 2.2 Defining Users and Roles

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: How to define users and roles in your application.
- **Goal**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

### 2.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: How to restrict access to resources based on user roles.
- **Goal**: Ensure users can only access resources they are authorized to use.

### 2.4 Storing User Credentials

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: How to store user credentials in a database.
- **Goal**: Move from in-memory authentication to database-backed authentication.

### 2.5 Password Encryption

- **What Youâ€™ll Learn**: How to store passwords securely using encryption.
- **Goal**: Protect user passwords from being exposed in plain text.

## 3. What Youâ€™ll Build

Youâ€™ll build a secure Spring Boot application with role-based access control and database-backed authentication.

### 3.1 Basic Security Configuration

- **What Youâ€™ll Do**: Add Spring Security to your project and secure all endpoints by default.
- **Tools**: Spring Boot, Spring Security.

#### Steps

1. Add the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency to your `pom.xml`.
2. Run the application and observe the default login form.
3. Use the auto-generated password (found in the console logs) to log in.

### 3.2 In-Memory Authentication

- **What Youâ€™ll Do**: Define users and roles in memory using a configuration class.
- **Tools**: Spring Security, Java Configuration.

#### Example

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("admin").password("{noop}admin123").roles("ADMIN")
            .and()
            .withUser("user").password("{noop}user123").roles("USER");
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Database-Backed Authentication

- **What Youâ€™ll Do**: Store user credentials and roles in a database.
- **Tools**: Spring Data JPA, MySQL, Spring Security.

#### Steps

1. Create a `User` entity and `Role` entity.
2. Configure Spring Security to use the database for authentication.
3. Implement custom queries to fetch user details.

### 3.4 Custom Security Configurations

- **What Youâ€™ll Do**: Define custom security rules for specific endpoints.
- **Tools**: Spring Security, Java Configuration.

#### Example

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .formLogin();
}
```
