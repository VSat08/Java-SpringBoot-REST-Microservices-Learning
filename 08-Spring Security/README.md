## 1. What Is Spring Security?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

Spring Security is a framework for securing Spring applications.

- **Definition**: Provides authentication and authorization tools.
- **Purpose**: Protects endpoints and resources from unauthorized access.

#### Real-World Analogy

Think of Spring Security as a bouncer—checking IDs (authentication) and VIP lists (authorization) before letting anyone in.

### 1.2 Why Security Matters

- **Protection**: Safeguards sensitive data.
- **Compliance**: Meets industry standards.
- **Trust**: Ensures user confidence.

#### Example Benefit

Restrict `/admin` access to only authorized users.

### 1.3 Key Terms for Beginners

| Term              | Meaning                                      | Example                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Authentication**| Verifying user identity                     | Login with username/password|
| **Authorization** | Determining access rights                    | Admin vs. user roles        |
| **Spring Security** | Security framework for Spring             | `@EnableWebSecurity`        |
| **In-Memory Auth**| Temp user storage for testing               | Hardcoded users             |
| **RBAC**          | Role-Based Access Control                    | `ROLE_ADMIN`                |

- **Goal**: Understand security foundations.

### 2.2 Spring Security Basics

- **What You’ll Learn**: Adding Spring Security to your app.
- **Goal**: Enable basic protection.

### 2.3 Implementing Authentication

- **What You’ll Learn**: In-memory and database authentication.
- **Goal**: Secure logins effectively.

### 2.4 Role-Based Access Control

- **What You’ll Learn**: Defining and applying roles.
- **Goal**: Control access by user type.

### 2.5 Securing RESTful APIs and MVC

## 3. What You’ll Build

You’ll secure an app with:
- Login for users (e.g., “admin”/“password”).
- Role-based access (e.g., admins see `/admin`).
- Protected REST endpoints (e.g., `/api/books`).

>[!NOTE]
>Security adds a professional touch to your apps!
