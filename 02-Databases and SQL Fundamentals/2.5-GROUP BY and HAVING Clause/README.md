## 1. Understanding GROUP BY and HAVING

### 1.1 What are GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses?
The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL groups rows with identical values in specified columns into summary rows, while the `HAVING` clause filters these groups based on aggregate conditions.

#### Definition
- **GROUP BY**: Organizes rows into groups based on column values.
- **HAVING**: Restricts grouped results using conditions on aggregate functions.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Summarize data within groups (e.g., `COUNT`, `SUM`).

#### Real-World Example
Imagine a sales report: `GROUP BY` totals sales by region, and `HAVING` shows only regions with sales above $10,000.

#### Key Terms
| Term            | Definition                                | Example                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| GROUP BY        | Groups rows by same values                | `GROUP BY emp_city`    |
| HAVING          | Filters grouped results                   | `HAVING COUNT(*) > 2`  |
| Summary Rows    | Aggregated data per group                 | Employees per city     |

### 1.2 Why Use GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses?
These clauses are crucial because they:
- Summarize data into meaningful categories (e.g., employees per city).
- Filter grouped data with aggregate conditions `WHERE` canâ€™t address.
- Enable sorting with `ORDER BY` for clear presentation.

#### Analogy
`GROUP BY` is like sorting books by genre, and `HAVING` keeps only genres with multiple titles.

## 2. GROUP BY and HAVING in SQL

### 2.1 Core Concepts
`GROUP BY` and `HAVING` extend the `SELECT` command in MySQL, integrating with `WHERE` and `ORDER BY`. `GROUP BY` consolidates rows by column values, and `HAVING` applies post-grouping filters using aggregates, necessitated by `WHERE`â€™s inability to handle aggregate functions.

### 2.2 Need for GROUP BY and HAVING
Raw data lacks structure without grouping. These clauses:
- Aggregate rows with matching values (e.g., cities, pay bands).
- Refine groups with conditions (e.g., count â‰¥ 3).
- Build comprehensive queries with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.

#### Snippet: Without GROUP BY
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```
*Output*: Lists all 10 rowsâ€”grouping condenses this into summaries (e.g., employees per city).

### 2.3 Using GROUP BY Clause
#### Definition
The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows in a table by one or more columns with identical values, producing summary rows typically paired with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, or `AVG`.

#### Usage Guide
- **Purpose**: Summarize data by categories (e.g., count employees per city).
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column, aggregate_function(column) FROM table_name GROUP BY column;`
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify the column to group by (e.g., `emp_city`).
  2. Choose an aggregate function (e.g., `COUNT(emp_id)`).
  3. Include only grouped columns or aggregates in `SELECT`.

##### Example 1: Employees per City
```sql
SELECT COUNT(emp_id) AS number_of_employees, emp_city FROM employee GROUP BY emp_city;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Group by `emp_city` to categorize employees by location.
- **Step 2**: Use `COUNT(emp_id)` to tally employees per city.
- **Step 3**: Alias as `number_of_employees` for clarity.
*Output*: Bangalore: 3, Hyderabad: 3, New Delhi: 2, Mumbai: 2.

##### Example 2: Employees per Pay Band
```sql
SELECT COUNT(emp_id), emp_pay FROM employee GROUP BY emp_pay;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Group by `emp_pay` to aggregate by salary levels.
- **Step 2**: Count employees (`COUNT(emp_id)`) per pay band.
- **Step 3**: Include `emp_pay` to show each groupâ€™s value.
*Output*: 56,000: 2, 66,000: 2, 75,000: 2, 78,000: 2, 86,000: 2.

##### Example 3: Cities per Country (World DB)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), countrycode FROM city GROUP BY countrycode;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Group by `countrycode` to summarize cities per country.
- **Step 2**: Use `COUNT(name)` to count cities in each group.
- **Step 3**: Select `countrycode` as the grouping key.
*Output*: 232 rows (e.g., CHN: 363, IND: 341).

> [!NOTE]
> Only columns in `GROUP BY` or aggregate functions can appear in `SELECT`.

### 2.4 Using HAVING Clause
#### Definition
The `HAVING` clause filters grouped results based on conditions applied to aggregate functions, used because `WHERE` cannot filter aggregates directly.

#### Usage Guide
- **Purpose**: Restrict groups post-`GROUP BY` (e.g., only groups with count > 2).
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column, aggregate_function(column) FROM table_name GROUP BY column HAVING condition;`
- **Steps**:
  1. Group data with `GROUP BY`.
  2. Define an aggregate condition (e.g., `COUNT(emp_id) >= 3`).
  3. Apply `HAVING` to filter groups.

##### Example 1: Cities with â‰¥ 3 Employees
```sql
SELECT COUNT(emp_id) AS number_of_employees, emp_city FROM employee GROUP BY emp_city HAVING COUNT(emp_id) >= 3;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Group by `emp_city`.
- **Step 2**: Count employees per city with `COUNT(emp_id)`.
- **Step 3**: Filter for cities with 3 or more employees using `HAVING`.
*Output*: Bangalore: 3, Hyderabad: 3.

##### Example 2: Countries with > 100 Cities
```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), countrycode FROM city GROUP BY countrycode HAVING COUNT(name) > 100;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Group by `countrycode`.
- **Step 2**: Count cities per country with `COUNT(name)`.
- **Step 3**: Keep only countries with over 100 cities.
*Output*: 8 rows (e.g., CHN: 363, IND: 341).

##### Example 3: Countries with > 50 Cities (Limited)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), countrycode FROM city GROUP BY countrycode HAVING COUNT(name) > 50 LIMIT 15;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Group by `countrycode`.
- **Step 2**: Count cities with `COUNT(name)`.
- **Step 3**: Filter for > 50 cities and limit to top 15.
*Output*: Top 15 (e.g., TUR: 62).

### 2.5 Combining with WHERE and ORDER BY
#### Definition
This combines `WHERE` to filter rows before grouping, `GROUP BY` to aggregate, `HAVING` to filter groups, and `ORDER BY` to sort the results, forming a full-fledged SQL query.

#### Usage Guide
- **Purpose**: Build complex queries with row filtering, grouping, group filtering, and sorting.
- **Syntax**: `SELECT column, aggregate_function(column) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column HAVING condition ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC];`
- **Steps**:
  1. Filter rows with `WHERE`.
  2. Group with `GROUP BY`.
  3. Filter groups with `HAVING`.
  4. Sort with `ORDER BY`.

##### Example 1: Employees per City with ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT COUNT(emp_id) AS number_of_employees, emp_city FROM employee GROUP BY emp_city ORDER BY COUNT(emp_id) DESC;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: No `WHERE` (all rows included).
- **Step 2**: Group by `emp_city`.
- **Step 3**: Count employees per city.
- **Step 4**: Sort by count descending (highest first).
*Output*: Bangalore: 3, Hyderabad: 3, New Delhi: 2, Mumbai: 2.

##### Example 2: Full Query with WHERE and HAVING
```sql
SELECT COUNT(emp_id) AS number_of_employees, emp_city FROM employee WHERE emp_city IN ('Hyderabad', 'Bangalore', 'Mumbai', 'New Delhi') GROUP BY emp_city HAVING COUNT(emp_id) >= 2 ORDER BY COUNT(emp_id) DESC, emp_city ASC;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Filter to specific cities with `WHERE emp_city IN (...)`.
- **Step 2**: Group by `emp_city`.
- **Step 3**: Keep groups with â‰¥ 2 employees using `HAVING`.
- **Step 4**: Sort by count descending, then city ascending.
*Output*: Bangalore: 3, Hyderabad: 3, Mumbai: 2, New Delhi: 2.

##### Example 3: Countries with 'i' in Code
```sql
SELECT COUNT(name), countrycode FROM city WHERE countrycode LIKE '%i%' GROUP BY countrycode HAVING COUNT(name) >= 10 ORDER BY COUNT(name) DESC;
```
*Guide*:
- **Step 1**: Filter countries with â€˜iâ€™ in `countrycode` using `WHERE`.
- **Step 2**: Group by `countrycode`.
- **Step 3**: Filter for â‰¥ 10 cities with `HAVING`.
- **Step 4**: Sort by count descending.
*Output*: IND: 341, IDN: 85, IRN: 67, ITA: 58, IRQ: 26, ISR: 17.

### 2.6 Implementation Overview
Runs in `my_db` with `employee` (10 rows, updated pays: 86,000 twice, 66,000 once) and `world` database (`city` table, 4079 rows, 232 countries). Builds on aggregate functions from prior session.

## 3. Practical Guidance

### 3.1 Best Practices
- Pair `GROUP BY` with aggregates (e.g., `COUNT(emp_id)`).
- Use `HAVING` for aggregate conditions, reserving `WHERE` for row filters.
- Sort with `ORDER BY` for readability (e.g., `COUNT(emp_id) DESC`).
- Limit large result sets with `LIMIT` (e.g., top 15 countries).

### 3.2 Common Pitfalls
- Including non-grouped, non-aggregated columns (e.g., `emp_name` with `GROUP BY emp_city`).
- Using `WHERE` for aggregates (e.g., `WHERE COUNT(*) > 2` fails).
- Misordering `ORDER BY` (e.g., sorting by `emp_id` instead of `COUNT(emp_id)`).
- Omitting `LIMIT` on large tables (e.g., `city` with 4079 rows).

### 3.3 Practice Exercises
1. Group employees by city and count them.
2. Find pay bands with exactly 2 employees.
3. List cities with â‰¥ 3 employees, ordered by count descending.
4. Group `city` by countrycode, filter for > 50 cities, limit to 10.
5. Count cities with â€˜dâ€™ in countrycode, filter for â‰¥ 10, order by count.

### 5.2 Summary
`GROUP BY` groups rows by column values (e.g., `emp_city`, `emp_pay`) in `employee` (10 rows) and `city` (4079 rows) tables, using aggregates like `COUNT`. `HAVING` filters these groups (e.g., `COUNT >= 3`), complementing `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` for full queries. Next: integrity constraints.

#### Highlights
- **GROUP BY**: Summarizes data (e.g., 3 in Bangalore).
- **HAVING**: Filters aggregates (e.g., `COUNT > 100`).
- **Full Query**: Combines `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.
- **Takeaway**: Master grouping for data analysis! ðŸŽ‰
