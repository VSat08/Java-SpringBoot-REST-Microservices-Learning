## 1. What Are SQL Views?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose
SQL views are virtual tables created from the result of a query. Unlike regular tables, they donâ€™t store data themselvesâ€”they pull it from underlying tables when you use them.

- **Definition**: A view is a saved query that acts like a table, displaying data from one or more real tables.
- **Purpose**: Simplify complex queries, hide unnecessary details, and control what data is visible.
- **Examples**: A view showing only Asian countries or a list of Indian cities with their country details.

#### Real-World Analogy
Imagine a view as a window:
- The room (real table) holds all the items.
- The window (view) shows only the part you want to see, like a specific corner.

### 1.2 Why Views Matter
Views make working with databases more efficient and secure:
- **Ease of Use**: Replace long queries with a simple `SELECT`.
- **Security**: Show only certain columns or rows, keeping sensitive data hidden.
- **Focus**: Present just the data you need, avoiding clutter.

#### Example Benefit
Instead of querying a table with 15 columns, a view can show just 4 key ones, like `code`, `name`, `continent`, and `population`.

### 1.3 Key Terms for Beginners
| Term             | Meaning                                   | Example                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **View**         | Virtual table from a query                | `country_view`         |
| **Base Table**   | Real table storing data                   | `country`              |
| **Virtual Table**| Table-like result, no data stored         | View of African countries |
| **Query**        | SQL statement defining the view           | `SELECT * FROM country WHERE continent = 'Asia'` |

## 2. Getting Started with Views in MySQL

### 2.1 How Views Work
In MySQL, views are created with a query that runs whenever you access them. They:
- Fetch data live from base tables (e.g., `country`, `city`).
- Look and act like tables for `SELECT` queries.
- Can include filters, joins, or functions.

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition];
```

#### Key Features
- **No Storage**: Views donâ€™t hold dataâ€”just the query.
- **Flexibility**: Build from one or multiple tables.
- **Simplicity**: Query with `SELECT * FROM view_name` like a table.

### 2.2 The Problem Without Views
Without views, youâ€™re stuck repeating complex queries or sifting through too much data.

#### Example: No View
```sql
SELECT code, name, continent, population
FROM country
WHERE continent = 'Asia';
```
- **Issue**: Long, repetitive queries; hard to manage with many columns or tables.

## 3. Core Operations with Views

### 3.1 Creating a View
#### Definition
`CREATE VIEW` sets up a new virtual table based on a query from one or more tables.

#### Why Use It?
To save a query for quick, repeated use (e.g., showing only certain columns).

#### Instructions
- Write `CREATE VIEW view_name AS` followed by a `SELECT` statement.
- Pick specific columns or use `*`.
- Test it with `SELECT * FROM view_name`.

#### Example 1: Single Table
```sql
CREATE VIEW country_view AS
SELECT code, name, continent, region, population, life_expectancy, capital
FROM country;
```
- **Output**: A view with 7 columns (out of 15), showing all rows from `country`.

#### Example 2: Filtered View
```sql
CREATE VIEW african_countries AS
SELECT *
FROM country
WHERE continent = 'Africa';
```
- **Output**: A view with 58 rows (African countries only).

#### Querying a View
```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM african_countries;
```
- **Output**: 58 rows with country names and capital city IDs.

### 3.2 Replacing a View
#### Definition
`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` updates an existing view with a new query, overwriting the old one.

#### Why Use It?
To change a viewâ€™s columns or conditions without deleting it first.

#### Instructions
- Use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` instead of `CREATE VIEW`.
- Adjust the `SELECT` statement.
- Check the update with `SELECT`.

#### Example 1: Update Columns
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW country_view AS
SELECT code, name, continent, population
FROM country;
```
- **Output**: Updated view with 4 columns (down from 7).

#### Example 2: Fix a Mistake
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW african_countries AS
SELECT *
FROM country
WHERE continent = 'Africa';
```
- **Output**: Corrected view, still showing 58 rows.

#### Querying Updated View
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM african_countries;
```
- **Output**: 58 (total African countries).

### 3.3 Dropping a View
#### Definition
`DROP VIEW` deletes a view from the database, leaving the base tables untouched.

#### Why Use It?
To remove outdated or incorrect views.

#### Instructions
- Run `DROP VIEW view_name`.
- Confirm removal with `SHOW FULL TABLES`.

#### Example
```sql
DROP VIEW african_countries;
```
- **Output**: View gone; `SHOW FULL TABLES` no longer shows it.

## 4. Advanced Uses of Views

### 4.1 Views on Multiple Tables
#### Definition
A view can merge data from multiple tables using joins, acting as a single table.

#### Why Use It?
To combine related data (e.g., country names with their cities).

#### Instructions
- Use a `JOIN` in the `SELECT` with an `ON` condition.
- Pick columns from each table.
- Test the view with `SELECT`.

#### Example: Country and City
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW indian_city_name_view AS
SELECT country.code, country.name AS country_name, city.id, city.name AS city_name
FROM country
JOIN city
ON country.code = city.countrycode
WHERE country.code = 'IND';
```
- **Output**: 341 rows with Indiaâ€™s code, name, city IDs, and city names.

#### Updated Example: Add Region
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW indian_city_name_view AS
SELECT country.code, country.name AS country_name, city.id, city.name AS city_name, country.region
FROM country
JOIN city
ON country.code = city.countrycode
WHERE country.code = 'IND';
```
- **Output**: 341 rows, now including `region` (e.g., "Southern and Central Asia").

#### Querying
```sql
SELECT * FROM indian_city_name_view LIMIT 25;
```
- **Output**: 25 rows with code, country name, city ID, city name, and region.

### 4.2 Views with Referential Actions
#### Definition
Views can reflect referential actions (e.g., `ON DELETE CASCADE`) from base tables, defining how changes propagate, though this is advanced and limited in MySQL views.

#### Why Use It?
To ensure views stay consistent with base table updates or deletes.

#### Instructions
- Set actions in base tables (not directly in the view).
- Note MySQL limits: views are often read-only for complex queries.

#### Example (Conceptual)
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(cid) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE VIEW order_view AS
SELECT * FROM orders;
```
- **Guide**: Deleting a customer removes related orders, and `order_view` shows the updated result.

#### Note
- Views with joins or filters are typically read-only; simple views may support updates.

## 5. Practical Application

### 5.1 Best Practices for Using Views
- **Clear Names**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `african_countries`, `indian_city_name_view`).
- **Minimal Columns**: Include only whatâ€™s needed for clarity.
- **Use Replace**: Update with `CREATE OR REPLACE` instead of dropping.
- **Verify Type**: Check with `SHOW FULL TABLES` to distinguish views from tables.
- **Hide Sensitive Data**: Omit columns like financial details.

### 5.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Too Many Columns**: Overcomplicates views and slows queries.
- **Duplicate Names**: `CREATE VIEW` fails if the view existsâ€”use `OR REPLACE`.
- **Base Table Changes**: Views break if underlying tables are altered.
- **Expecting Updates**: Complex views (e.g., with joins) canâ€™t be updated directly.

### 5.3 Hands-On Exercises
1. **Create a View**: Build a view of European countries from `country`.
2. **Replace a View**: Update it to show only `name` and `population`.
3. **Drop a View**: Delete it and check with `SHOW FULL TABLES`.
4. **Multi-Table View**: Merge `country` and `city` for US cities.
5. **Query a View**: Count rows in a view of African countries.

## 6. Comparing Views and Tables

### 6.1 Views vs. Base Tables
| Feature          | Views                     | Base Tables              |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Data Storage** | None (virtual)            | Holds actual data        |
| **Creation**     | From a query              | Defined with `CREATE TABLE` |
| **Columns**      | Subset or combined        | All defined columns      |
| **Use Case**     | Simplified access         | Raw data storage         |
| **Type Check**   | `SHOW FULL TABLES` (VIEW) | `SHOW FULL TABLES` (BASE_TABLE) |
