## 1. What Are SQL Joins?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose
SQL joins are commands that let you combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column, like a `PRIMARY KEY` or `FOREIGN KEY`. Theyâ€™re the glue that connects separate tables in a database.

- **Definition**: A join is a query that merges data from multiple tables using a condition (e.g., matching IDs).
- **Purpose**: To retrieve related information spread across tables, making your data more useful.
- **Examples**: `INNER JOIN` (matches only), `LEFT JOIN` (all from left), `RIGHT JOIN` (all from right), `CROSS JOIN` (all combinations), `SELF JOIN` (table with itself).

#### Real-World Analogy
Think of a library:
- One table lists books (`book_id`, `title`).
- Another lists borrowers (`borrower_id`, `book_id`, `name`).
- A join links them to see who borrowed which book!

### 1.2 Why Joins Matter
Databases split data into tables to avoid repetition (a process called *normalization*). Joins bring it back together:
- **Unify Data**: Combine customer names with their orders.
- **Reduce Redundancy**: No need to store customer details in every order row.
- **Answer Questions**: Find orders by country without duplicate data.

#### Normalization Basics
- Tables are simplified (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd Normal Form) to reduce dependency.
- Joins use keys (e.g., `cid` in `customers`, `customer_id` in `orders`) to reconnect them.

### 1.3 Key Terms for Beginners
| Term             | Meaning                                   | Example                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Join**         | Merging tables based on a condition       | `customers JOIN orders`|
| **Condition**    | Rule for matching rows                    | `cid = customer_id`    |
| **Left Table**   | First table in the query                  | `customers`            |
| **Right Table**  | Second table in the query                 | `orders`               |
| **NULL**         | Empty value when no match is found        | `customer_id = NULL`   |

## 2. Getting Started with Joins in MySQL

### 2.1 How Joins Work
In MySQL, joins combine tables using a `SELECT` statement with a `JOIN` clause and an `ON` condition. They:
- Match rows based on a column (e.g., `cid` and `customer_id`).
- Return a single result table with columns from both.
- Can join two or more tables (weâ€™ll start with two).

#### Basic Syntax
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN_TYPE table2
ON condition;
```
- **columns**: What you want (e.g., `cid`, `order_amount`).
- **table1**: Left table.
- **JOIN_TYPE**: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CROSS`.
- **table2**: Right table.
- **condition**: Matching rule (e.g., `table1.id = table2.id`).

#### Aliasing
Shorten table names for clarity (e.g., `customers AS c`).

### 2.2 The Problem Without Joins
Without joins, youâ€™re stuck querying one table at a time, missing the full picture.

#### Example: Separate Queries
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers; -- Shows cid, cname, country
SELECT * FROM orders;    -- Shows order_id, customer_id, amount
```
- **Issue**: No way to see customer names with their ordersâ€”manual matching is tedious!

## 3. Core SQL Joins

### 3.1 INNER JOIN
#### Definition
`INNER JOIN` (or just `JOIN`) returns only rows where the condition matches in *both* tables. Itâ€™s also called an *equijoin* because it uses equality (`=`).

#### Why Use It?
To find data that exists in both tables (e.g., customers who placed orders).

#### Instructions
- Use `INNER JOIN` with an `ON` condition.
- Select specific columns or all (`*`).
- Test with matching and non-matching data.

#### Example 1: Full Data
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.cid = orders.customer_id;
```
- **Setup**: `customers` (7 rows), `orders` (4 rows with `customer_id = 2, 3, 5, 104`).
- **Output**: 4 rows where `cid` matches `customer_id`.

#### Example 2: Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT customers.cid, customers.cname, orders.order_id, orders.order_amount
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.cid = orders.customer_id;
```
- **Output**: 4 rows with `cid`, `cname`, `order_id`, `order_amount`.

#### Example 3: With Aliasing
```sql
SELECT c.cid, c.cname, o.order_id, o.order_amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
ON c.cid = o.customer_id;
```
- **Output**: Same 4 rows, cleaner syntax.

#### Visual Depiction
```
customers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]    orders: [2, 3, 5, 104]
INNER JOIN result: [2, 3, 5, 104]   (intersection)
```

### 3.2 LEFT JOIN
#### Definition
`LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`) returns *all* rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. Non-matching right table columns get `NULL`.

#### Why Use It?
To include all left table data, even if thereâ€™s no match (e.g., customers without orders).

#### Instructions
- Replace `INNER JOIN` with `LEFT JOIN`.
- Check for `NULL` in right table columns.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT c.cid, c.cname, o.order_id, o.order_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.cid = o.customer_id;
```
- **Setup**: `customers` (7 rows), `orders` (4 matches).
- **Output**: 7 rows; `order_id` and `order_amount` are `NULL` for `cid = 1, 4, 6, 7`.

#### Visual Depiction
```
customers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]    orders: [2, 3, 5, 104]
LEFT JOIN result: [1(NULL), 2, 3, 4(NULL), 5, 6(NULL), 7(NULL)]
```

### 3.3 RIGHT JOIN
#### Definition
`RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`) returns *all* rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. Non-matching left table columns get `NULL`.

#### Why Use It?
To prioritize right table data (e.g., all orders, even if customer data is missing).

#### Instructions
- Use `RIGHT JOIN` instead of `LEFT JOIN`.
- Look for `NULL` in left table columns.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT c.cid, c.cname, o.order_id, o.order_amount
FROM customers c
RIGHT JOIN orders o
ON c.cid = o.customer_id;
```
- **Setup**: `customers` (7 rows), `orders` (4 rows).
- **Output**: 4 rows; all `orders` rows appear, matching `customers` where possible.

#### Visual Depiction
```
customers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]    orders: [2, 3, 5, 104]
RIGHT JOIN result: [2, 3, 5, 104]   (all from orders)
```

### 3.4 CROSS JOIN
#### Definition
`CROSS JOIN` creates a *Cartesian product*, combining every row from the left table with every row from the right tableâ€”no condition needed.

#### Why Use It?
To generate all possible combinations (e.g., testing scenarios), but use cautiously due to large results.

#### Instructions
- Use `CROSS JOIN` without an `ON` clause.
- Calculate rows: left rows Ã— right rows.

#### Example
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
CROSS JOIN orders;
```
- **Setup**: `customers` (7 rows), `orders` (4 rows).
- **Output**: 28 rows (7 Ã— 4).

#### Example: Inner Join Without Condition
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders;
```
- **Output**: Same 28 rows (acts like `CROSS JOIN` without `ON`).

#### Visual Depiction
```
customers: [1, 2, 3]    orders: [A, B]
CROSS JOIN result: [1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B]   (all pairs)
```

## 4. Special Case: SELF JOIN

### 4.1 What Is a SELF JOIN?
#### Definition
A `SELF JOIN` is any join (`INNER`, `LEFT`, etc.) where a table is joined with *itself*. You use aliases to treat it as two separate tables.

#### Why Use It?
To find relationships within the same table (e.g., employees and their managers from one table).

#### Instructions
- Alias the table twice (e.g., `A` and `B`).
- Define a condition linking columns.

### 4.2 Applying SELF JOIN
#### Example (Conceptual)
```sql
SELECT A.cid, A.cname, B.cid AS related_cid, B.cname AS related_cname
FROM customers A
INNER JOIN customers B
ON A.cid = B.cid + 1;
```
- **Setup**: Imagine `customers` has related pairs (e.g., `cid=1` links to `cid=2`).
- **Output**: Pairs like (2, 'David', 1, 'Ram') if data supports it.

#### Note
- Real example deferred to next lecture (using `world` database).
- Key idea: Same table, different roles via aliases.

## 5. Practical Application

### 5.1 Best Practices for Using Joins
- **Use Conditions**: Always specify `ON` for `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` joins.
- **Alias Tables**: Shorten names (e.g., `c`, `o`) for readability.
- **Select Specific Columns**: Avoid `*` for clarity in production.
- **Test Small First**: Run on small datasets to understand results.
- **Avoid Overusing CROSS JOIN**: Limit to small tables due to size explosion.

### 5.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Missing ON Clause**: Turns `INNER JOIN` into `CROSS JOIN`.
- **Wrong Table Order**: Confuses `LEFT` vs. `RIGHT` results.
- **Ignoring NULLs**: Misinterpreting unmatched rows.
- **Overcomplicating**: Start with two tables before multi-table joins.

### 5.3 Hands-On Exercises
1. **INNER JOIN**: Combine `customers` and `orders` to list orders with customer names.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Find all customers, including those without orders.
3. **RIGHT JOIN**: List all orders, even if customer data is missing.
4. **CROSS JOIN**: Generate all customer-order pairs and count rows.
5. **SELF JOIN**: (Conceptual) Pair customers with consecutive `cid` values.

## 6. Comparing Joins

### 6.1 INNER vs. OUTER Joins
| Feature          | INNER JOIN                | OUTER JOIN (LEFT/RIGHT)  |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Rows Returned**| Matches only              | All from one table + matches |
| **NULLs**        | None                      | In non-matching columns  |
| **Use Case**     | Exact matches             | Include unmatched data   |

### 6.2 LEFT JOIN vs. RIGHT JOIN
| Feature          | LEFT JOIN                 | RIGHT JOIN               |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Priority**     | All from left table       | All from right table     |
| **NULLs**        | Right table columns       | Left table columns       |
| **Swap Trick**   | `LEFT JOIN B` = `RIGHT JOIN A` | `RIGHT JOIN B` = `LEFT JOIN A` |

- [W3Schools SQL Joins](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp)

### 7.2 Summary of Key Takeaways
Lecture 85 introduces MySQL joins with `my_db` (`customers`, `orders`):
- **INNER JOIN**: Matches only (4 rows from 7 and 4).
- **LEFT JOIN**: All customers (7 rows, `NULL` for 3).
- **RIGHT JOIN**: All orders (4 rows, all matched here).
- **CROSS JOIN**: All combinations (28 rows).
- **SELF JOIN**: Table with itself (example pending `world` database).

#### Highlights
- **Purpose**: Joins reconnect normalized tables.
- **Conditions**: Critical for `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
- **Beginner Tip**: Start with `INNER JOIN`, then explore `LEFT` and `RIGHT`.
