## 1. What Are TCL Commands?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose
TCL, or Transaction Control Language, includes SQL commands that manage transactions in a MySQL database. The main commands are `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

- **Definition**: TCL commands control a transactionâ€”a sequence of SQL statements treated as one unit of work.
- **Purpose**: Ensure data changes are saved permanently (`COMMIT`), undone completely (`ROLLBACK`), or partially reverted (`SAVEPOINT`).
- **Example**: Transferring money between accounts with debit and credit steps.

#### Real-World Analogy
Think of a transaction as mailing a package:
- `COMMIT`: Package delivered and accepted.
- `ROLLBACK`: Package returned to sender.
- `SAVEPOINT`: Mark a checkpoint (e.g., at the post office) to return to if needed.

### 1.2 Why TCL Commands Matter
TCL ensures data integrity and reliability:
- **Atomicity**: All steps succeed, or none do.
- **Control**: Decide when changes stick or revert.
- **Flexibility**: Undo parts of a transaction with savepoints.

#### Example Benefit
Debiting 5,000 from one account and crediting another only saves if both steps workâ€”otherwise, it rolls back.

### 1.3 Key Terms for Beginners
| Term             | Meaning                                   | Example                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Transaction**  | Sequence of SQL statements as one unit    | Debit and credit       |
| **Commit**       | Save changes permanently                  | `COMMIT;`              |
| **Rollback**     | Undo changes to last commit               | `ROLLBACK;`            |
| **Savepoint**    | Checkpoint within a transaction           | `SAVEPOINT a;`         |
| **Autocommit**   | Automatic commit of each statement        | `SET autocommit = 0;`  |

## 2. Getting Started with TCL in MySQL

### 2.1 How TCL Works
TCL commands manage transactions by:
- Grouping SQL statements (e.g., `UPDATE`, `INSERT`) into a single unit.
- Using `COMMIT` to save, `ROLLBACK` to undo, or `SAVEPOINT` to mark revert points.
- Requiring manual control when `autocommit` is disabled.

#### Basic Flow
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
UPDATE table SET column = value;
COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK;
```

#### Key Features
- **Permanent**: Committed changes canâ€™t be undone.
- **Reversible**: Rollback restores the pre-transaction state.
- **Segmented**: Savepoints allow partial rollbacks.

### 2.2 The Problem Without TCL
Without TCL, every SQL statement commits instantly (with `autocommit = 1`), risking partial updates.

#### Example: No TCL
- Debit 5,000 succeeds, but credit failsâ€”data is inconsistent.
- **Issue**: No way to undo the debit alone.

### 2.3 Setting Up Transactions
#### Definition
Transactions need `autocommit` disabled to use TCL commands effectively.

#### Why Use It?
To control commits and rollbacks manually, avoiding automatic saves.

#### Instructions
1. **Check Autocommit**:
   ```sql
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'autocommit';
   ```
   - Default: `ON` (1).

2. **Disable Autocommit**:
   ```sql
   SET autocommit = 0;
   ```
   - Now, changes wait for `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

3. **Start Transaction** (optional):
   - Use `START TRANSACTION;` for clarity (not required with `autocommit = 0`).

#### Example
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 5000 WHERE account_number = 444;
```

## 3. Core TCL Commands

### 3.1 COMMIT Command
#### Definition
`COMMIT` saves all changes in the current transaction permanently.

#### Why Use It?
To finalize a successful transaction (e.g., money transfer).

#### Instructions
- Run SQL statements.
- End with `COMMIT;`.
- Verify with `SELECT`.

#### Example: Money Transfer
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 5000 WHERE account_number = 444;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 5000 WHERE account_number = 222;
COMMIT;
```
- **Output**: 444 drops from 50,000 to 45,000; 222 rises from 15,000 to 20,000â€”permanent.

#### Verify
```sql
SELECT * FROM account;
```
- **Output**: Changes saved.

### 3.2 ROLLBACK Command
#### Definition
`ROLLBACK` undoes all changes since the last `COMMIT` or transaction start.

#### Why Use It?
To cancel a failed or unwanted transaction.

#### Instructions
- Run SQL statements.
- Use `ROLLBACK;` if needed.
- Check with `SELECT`.

#### Example: Undo Transfer
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 5000 WHERE account_number = 444;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 5000 WHERE account_number = 222;
SELECT * FROM account; -- 444: 40,000, 222: 20,000
ROLLBACK;
```
- **Output**: Back to 444: 45,000, 222: 15,000 (post-last `COMMIT`).

#### Verify
```sql
SELECT * FROM account;
```
- **Output**: Changes reverted.

### 3.3 SAVEPOINT Command
#### Definition
`SAVEPOINT` marks a point in a transaction to roll back to, instead of undoing everything.

#### Why Use It?
To undo part of a transaction while keeping earlier steps.

#### Instructions
- Set `SAVEPOINT name;`.
- Run more statements.
- Use `ROLLBACK TO name;` to revert to that point.

#### Example: Partial Rollback
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 5000 WHERE account_number = 444; -- 45,000 to 40,000
SAVEPOINT a;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 5000 WHERE account_number = 222; -- 15,000 to 20,000
SELECT * FROM account; -- 444: 40,000, 222: 20,000
ROLLBACK TO a;
```
- **Output**: 444: 40,000 (kept), 222: 15,000 (reverted to before savepoint).

#### Verify
```sql
SELECT * FROM account;
```
- **Output**: Partial changes undone.

## 4. Practical Application

### 4.1 Best Practices for TCL
- **Disable Autocommit**: Always `SET autocommit = 0` for TCL.
- **Commit Wisely**: Only commit when all steps succeed.
- **Use Savepoints**: Mark key points for complex transactions.
- **Verify Changes**: Check with `SELECT` before committing.
- **Keep Transactions Short**: Minimize uncommitted changes.

### 4.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Forgetting Autocommit**: Default `ON` commits everything instantly.
- **Committing Too Early**: Canâ€™t rollback after `COMMIT`.
- **Missing Savepoints**: Limits rollback flexibility.
- **Long Transactions**: Risks locking or performance issues.

### 4.3 Hands-On Exercises
1. **Commit a Transfer**: Debit 5,000 from 111, credit 222, and commit.
2. **Rollback a Change**: Debit 5,000 from 444, then rollback.
3. **Use Savepoint**: Debit 5,000 from 444, set a savepoint, credit 222, rollback to savepoint.
4. **Test Autocommit**: Run an update with `autocommit = 1`, then try rollback.
5. **Multi-Step Transaction**: Debit and credit twice, rollback to an earlier savepoint.

## 5. Comparing TCL Commands

### 5.1 COMMIT vs. ROLLBACK vs. SAVEPOINT
| Feature          | COMMIT                  | ROLLBACK               | SAVEPOINT              |
|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Action**       | Saves permanently       | Undoes to last commit  | Marks a revert point   |
| **Syntax**       | `COMMIT;`               | `ROLLBACK;`            | `SAVEPOINT name;`      |
| **Scope**        | Entire transaction      | Entire transaction     | Partial transaction    |
| **Undo Possible**| No                      | Yes (pre-commit)       | Yes (to savepoint)     |
| **Use Case**     | Finalize success        | Cancel failure         | Partial rollback       |

- W3Schools SQL Transactions: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_transaction.asp

### 6.2 Summary of Key Takeaways
This guide explores TCL with `sample_db`â€™s `account` table:
- **COMMIT**: Saved a 5,000 transfer (444: 45,000, 222: 20,000).
- **ROLLBACK**: Undid a 5,000 transfer back to 45,000 and 15,000.
- **SAVEPOINT**: Reverted a credit after a debit, keeping 444 at 40,000.

#### Highlights
- **Atomicity**: TCL ensures all-or-nothing changes.
- **Control**: Manage transactions with precision.
- **Tip**: Always disable `autocommit` first.
