## Learning Path: Topics Overview

This Databases and SQL Fundamentals course is structured into a series of topics to guide you from foundational concepts to practical applications. Progress through these topics sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding, culminating in a mini project:

- **Introduction to DBMS**: Understand what databases and DBMS are, focusing on relational DBMS (RDBMS) and their differences from other systems like hierarchical and network DBMS.
- **Introduction to MySQL**: Explore MySQLâ€™s features, set up your environment, create databases, and work with tables and views.
- **SQL Basics and Commands**: Learn Structured Query Language (SQL) commandsâ€”including DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), TCL (Transaction Control Language), and DCL (Data Control Language)â€”to interact with MySQL.
- **Data Retrieval with SQL**: Master the `SELECT` command, using clauses like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `LIKE` to query data effectively.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Use functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to analyze data.
- **Integrity Constraints**: Explore constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, check, and unique constraints to ensure data integrity and relationships between tables.
- **Joins and Subqueries**: Join multiple tables and write subqueries to retrieve complex data sets.
- **PL/SQL Programming**: Dive into PL/SQL (Programming Language/SQL) to write procedures and functions, adding procedural logic to SQL.

## Setting Up Your MySQL Environment

Before diving into SQL, youâ€™ll need to set up MySQL, the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) weâ€™ll use throughout this course. This section guides you through the installation, verification, and initial usage of MySQL, ensuring youâ€™re ready to start working with databases.

### What is MySQL?
MySQL is a popular open-source RDBMS that stores data in a structured format using tables with rows and columns. Itâ€™s compliant with standard SQL, making it a versatile choice for managing databases.

#### Key Points
- **Ownership**: Now owned by Oracle Corporation (previously Sun Microsystems)
- **Versions**:
  - **MySQL Community Server**: Free, open-source version
  - **MySQL Enterprise Edition**: Licensed, commercial version
- **Compatibility**: Works with standard SQL and integrates with languages like PHP and Perl
- **Usage**: Handles large databases with high performance, reliability, and robust security features

### Installation Options
MySQL offers several ways to set up your environment, depending on your preferences:
- **MySQL Community Server**: Standalone installation for command-line interface (CLI) usage (free).
- **MySQL Workbench**: GUI tool for managing databases visually.
- **MySQL Client Utilities**: Lightweight CLI tools for direct command-line access.
- **Software Stacks**:
  - **WAMP (Windows)**: Includes Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP
  - **LAMP (Linux)**: Similar to WAMP but for Linux
  - **XAMPP (Cross-Platform)**: Includes Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP, and Perl; works on Windows, Linux, macOS

>[!TIP]  
>For beginners, using WAMP, LAMP, or XAMPP provides both CLI and GUI (via phpMyAdmin), making it easier to learn and experiment.

### Downloading and Installing MySQL
1. **Option 1: MySQL Community Server (Standalone)**
   - Visit [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   - Select **MySQL Community Server** (free version)
   - Choose your OS (Windows, Linux, macOS)
   - Download and run the installer
   - Follow the setup wizard:
     - Select "Developer Default" for learning purposes
     - Set a root password (optional for now; can be set later)
     - Complete the installation

2. **Option 2: MySQL Workbench (GUI)**
   - Visit [MySQL Workbench Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
   - Download and install MySQL Workbench
   - It includes MySQL Community Server and provides a graphical interface

3. **Option 3: Using Software Stacks (WAMP/LAMP/XAMPP)**
   - **Windows (WAMP)**:
     - Download WAMP from [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
     - Install by clicking "Next" through the wizard
     - WAMP includes Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP, and phpMyAdmin
   - **Linux (LAMP)**:
     - Install via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install lamp-server` on Ubuntu)
     - Includes Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP
   - **Cross-Platform (XAMPP)**:
     - Download XAMPP from [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
     - Install for your OS
     - Includes Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP, Perl, and phpMyAdmin

### Verifying Installation
- **Start MySQL Server**:
  - WAMP/XAMPP: Launch the control panel; ensure MySQL and Apache services are running (green indicators)
  - Standalone: Start via command (e.g., `mysql.server start`) or system services
- **Access MySQL Console**:
  - Command: `mysql -u root -p`
  - Default username: `root`
  - Password: None initially (press Enter); set later if needed
- **Check Version**:
  ```sql
  SELECT VERSION();
  ```
  - Example Output: `8.0.31`
- **Check Current User**:
  ```sql
  SELECT USER();
  ```
  - Example Output: `root@localhost`

### Using MySQL Console
The MySQL Console is a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with MySQL:
- **Show Databases**:
  ```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
  ```
  - Lists default databases: `information_schema`, `mysql`, `performance_schema`, `sys`
- **Create a Database**:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE sms;
  ```
- **Use a Database**:
  ```sql
  USE sms;
  ```
- **Verify Current Database**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DATABASE();
  ```
  - Output: `sms`
- **Show Tables**:
  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES;
  ```
  - Output: `Empty set` (if no tables exist)
- **Describe Table Structure**:
  ```sql
  DESCRIBE table_name;
  ```
  - Example (if a table `employee` exists):
    ```
    +----------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field          | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +----------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | employee_id    | int         | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | employee_name  | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | employee_salary| double      | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    | city           | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
    +----------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    ```
- **Clear Screen**:
  ```sql
  SYSTEM CLS;
  ```
- **Exit Console**:
  ```sql
  QUIT;
  ```

### Using phpMyAdmin (Optional)
phpMyAdmin, included with WAMP/LAMP/XAMPP, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for MySQL:
- **Access phpMyAdmin**:
  - Start WAMP/XAMPP services
  - Open a browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
  - Login with username `root` and no password (unless set)
- **Features**:
  - View databases and tables visually
  - Click to manage tables, insert data, or run queries
  - Example: Select a database â†’ Click a table â†’ View data or structure
- **Run SQL Queries**:
  - Use the SQL tab to write queries (e.g., `SELECT * FROM table_name`)
  - Execute and view results graphically

>[!NOTE]  
>phpMyAdmin mirrors MySQL Console functionality but with a GUI, ideal for non-technical users or those preferring visual management.
