## Learning Path: Topics Overview

This SQL Fundamentals course is organized into a series of topics to guide you from foundational concepts to practical applications. Progress through these topics sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding, culminating in a mini project. Below is an overview of what youâ€™ll cover:

- **Introduction to DBMS**: Understand what databases and DBMS are, focusing on relational DBMS (RDBMS) and their differences from other systems like hierarchical and network DBMS.
- **Introduction to MySQL**: Set up MySQL, create databases, and work with tables and views.
- **SQL Basics and Commands**: Learn Structured Query Language (SQL) commandsâ€”DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), TCL (Transaction Control Language), and DCL (Data Control Language)â€”to interact with MySQL.
- **Data Retrieval with SQL**: Master the `SELECT` command, using clauses like `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `LIKE` to query data effectively.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Use functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to analyze data.
- **Integrity Constraints**: Explore constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, check, and unique constraints to ensure data integrity and relationships between tables.
- **Joins and Subqueries**: Join multiple tables and write subqueries to retrieve complex data sets.
- **PL/SQL Programming**: Dive into PL/SQL (Programming Language/SQL) to write procedures and functions, adding procedural logic to SQL.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Connect Java programs to MySQL, performing CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) using the JDBC API.
- **Mini Project**: Apply your skills in a practical project to manage a database-driven application with Java and MySQL.

Each topic includes detailed explanations, examples, and exercises to reinforce your learning. Start with the basics and progressively tackle more advanced concepts, culminating in the mini project to solidify your understanding.

## Understanding Database Fundamentals

### What is a Database?
A *database* is an organized collection of data, typically stored in a structured format for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It consists of tables, where each table contains rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet.

#### Example
A student database might have a table `Students`:
| ID  | Name    | GPA | City   |
|-----|---------|-----|--------|
| 101 | Alice   | 8.5 | Pune   |
| 102 | Bob     | 9.0 | Mumbai |

### What is a DBMS?
A *Database Management System (DBMS)* is software that facilitates the creation, management, and interaction with databases. It provides tools to define data structures, query data, and ensure security and integrity.

#### Role of DBMS
- Manages data storage and retrieval
- Enforces data constraints
- Handles concurrent access by multiple users

### Types of DBMS
- **Structured (Relational) DBMS (RDBMS)**:
  - Organizes data into tables with relationships
  - Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server
- **Unstructured DBMS**:
  - Handles non-tabular data (e.g., documents, graphs)
  - Examples: MongoDB (NoSQL), Neo4j
- **Hierarchical DBMS**:
  - Tree-like structure with parent-child relationships
  - Example: IBM IMS
- **Network DBMS**:
  - Graph-like structure with many-to-many relationships
  - Example: IDS (Integrated Data Store)

### Popular RDBMS Options
- **MySQL**: Open-source, widely used for web applications
- **Oracle Database**: Enterprise-grade, robust for large systems
- **SQL Server**: Microsoftâ€™s RDBMS, integrates with Windows ecosystems
- **DB2**: IBMâ€™s solution for enterprise data management
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, advanced features for complex queries

## Introduction to MySQL

### Why MySQL?
MySQL is chosen for this course due to its:
- **Open-Source Nature**: Free to use, with a large community
- **Ease of Use**: Beginner-friendly syntax and setup
- **Wide Adoption**: Popular in web development (e.g., LAMP stack)
- **Performance**: Efficient for small to medium-sized applications

### Key Features
- Supports relational database structures (tables, keys)
- Provides SQL compatibility for querying
- Offers scalability and security features
- Runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)

   - Visit [MySQL Official Website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   - Choose the version compatible with your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Download the installer

2. **Install MySQL**
   - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
   - Select "Developer Default" setup type for learning purposes
   - Set a root password and configure server settings
   - Verify installation by running `mysql --version` in the terminal

3. **Install MySQL Workbench (Optional)**
   - Download MySQL Workbench for a GUI interface
   - Use it to manage databases visually

### Basic Configuration
- **Start MySQL Server**:
  - On Windows: Use Services or `mysql.server start`
  - On Linux/macOS: `sudo systemctl start mysql` or `mysql.server start`
- **Access MySQL**:
  - Command: `mysql -u root -p`
  - Enter the root password set during installation
- **Create a Database**:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE mydb;
  USE mydb;
  ```

## SQL Basics

### What is SQL?
*Structured Query Language (SQL)* is a standard language for interacting with RDBMS. It allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete data in a database, as well as manage database structures and permissions.

#### Key Characteristics
- Declarative: Specify what data you want, not how to get it
- Universal: Works across RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server
- Versatile: Handles data definition, manipulation, and control

### SQL Command Categories
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:
  - Defines and modifies database structures
  - Examples: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:
  - Manages data within tables
  - Examples: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**:
  - Manages transactions
  - Examples: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**:
  - Controls access and permissions
  - Examples: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`
