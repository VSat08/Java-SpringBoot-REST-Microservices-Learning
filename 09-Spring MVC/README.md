## 1. What Is Spring MVC?

### 1.1 Definition and Purpose

Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications using the MVC pattern.

- **Definition**: Separates logic (Model), UI (View), and requests (Controller).
- **Purpose**: Creates structured, maintainable web apps.

#### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a restaurant: the chef (Model) prepares food, the waiter (Controller) takes orders, and the plate (View) presents it.

### 1.2 Why Spring MVC Matters

- **Organization**: Keeps code modular.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various view technologies.
- **User Interaction**: Handles forms and requests easily.

#### Example Benefit

Display a book list on a webpage with clickable updates.

### 1.3 Key Terms for Beginners

| Term              | Meaning                                      | Example                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **MVC**           | Model-View-Controller pattern                | Data, UI, logic separation  |
| **Controller**    | Handles requests and responses               | `@Controller` class         |
| **Thymeleaf**     | Template engine for views                    | `<h1 th:text="${title}">`   |
| **Request Mapping** | Maps URLs to methods                     | `@GetMapping("/books")`     |
| **Lombok**        | Simplifies Java beans                        | `@Data` annotation          |
