## Understanding Java Program Structure

### Basic Program Components
```java
public class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
    }
}
```

### Program Structure Rules
1. **Class Definition**
   * Every Java program must have at least one class
   * Public class name must match filename
   * Class is a block containing methods

2. **Main Method**
   * Entry point of program
   * Must be public and static
   * Takes String array as argument
   * Void return type

### Naming Conventions
1. **Classes and Interfaces**
   * Follow CamelCase
   * Start with capital letter
   * Example: `HelloWorld`, `StudentRecord`

2. **Methods and Variables**
   * Start with lowercase
   * Use camelCase for multiple words
   * Example: `calculateTotal`, `studentName`

### Keywords and Reserved Words
* Java has 53 reserved words
* Common keywords in basic programs:
  * `public`: Access modifier
  * `class`: Defines a class
  * `static`: Allows method call without object
  * `void`: Indicates no return value

## Writing Your First Java Program

### Program Creation Steps
1. Create new file with `.java` extension
2. Write class matching filename
3. Include main method
4. Add program statements
5. Save file
6. Compile using `javac` command
7. Run using `java` command

### Program Execution Flow
1. JVM searches for main method
2. Execution begins at main
3. Statements executed sequentially
4. Output displayed on console

---

## Java Program Components in Detail

### Class Structure
* Defined using `class` keyword
* Contains methods and variables
* Public classes must match filename
* Uses block structure with curly braces

### Main Method
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
* **public**: Accessible from anywhere
* **static**: Called without object creation
* **void**: No return value
* **String[] args**: Command-line arguments parameter

### Visibility Specifiers
1. **public**
   * Accessible from anywhere
   * Used for classes and methods
   * Required for main method

2. **private**
   * Accessible only within class
   * Provides encapsulation

3. **protected**
   * Accessible within package and subclasses
   * Intermediate level of protection

4. **default**
   * No explicit specifier
   * Package-level access

### Code Blocks
* Defined by curly braces `{}`
* Types of blocks:
  * Class blocks
  * Method blocks
  * Statement blocks
* Each block creates its own scope

### Special Symbols
* `{}`: Define blocks
* `()`: Used with methods
* `[]`: Array notation
* `""`: String literals
* `;`: Statement terminator

### Comments
```java
// Single-line comment

/* Multi-line
   comment block */
```

## Java Package System

### Java.lang Package
* Automatically imported
* Contains fundamental classes:
  * System
  * String
