## 1. Understanding Nested Classes

### 1.1 What are Nested Classes?
- **Definition**: *Nested Classes* are classes defined within another class in Java. This nesting allows one class (the inner or nested class) to reside inside an enclosing class (the outer class), creating a hierarchical structure. Introduced in Java 1.1, nested classes enhance flexibility and organization in OOP.
- **OOP Context**: Nested classes complement OOP principles like encapsulation and inheritance by embedding related functionality within a single unit, often reflecting real-world relationships.
- **Real-World Example**: Think of a **Car** (outer class) with an **Engine** (nested class). The engine is a critical part of the carâ€”without it, the car doesnâ€™t functionâ€”mirroring a composition relationship where nesting makes sense.
- **Key Terms**:
  - *Outer Class*: The enclosing class containing the nested class (e.g., `Car`).
  - *Nested Class*: The class defined inside another class (e.g., `Engine`).
  - *Inner Class*: A non-static nested class tied to an instance of the outer class.
  - *Static Nested Class*: A static nested class independent of outer class instances.

### 1.2 Advantages of Nested Classes
- **Logical Grouping**: Nesting groups related classes together, reflecting their relationship (e.g., `Car` and `Engine`), making code more intuitive.
- **Enhanced Encapsulation**: Adds an extra layer of privacy and control, as inner classes can access outer class members, even private ones.
- **Improved Readability & Maintainability**: Reduces clutter by keeping related logic in one place, minimizing external dependencies.

| Advantage             | Description                                      | Example                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Logical Grouping      | Ties related classes together logically         | `Car` with `Engine`         |
| Enhanced Encapsulation| Increases data protection within a unit         | Inner accessing outer data  |
| Readability           | Keeps code concise and organized                | Less external class files   |

## 2. Nested Classes in Java

### 2.1 Core Concepts
- **How It Works**: A nested class is declared within the curly braces of an outer class, inheriting its scope and access privileges. Java categorizes them into **static nested classes** (independent) and **inner classes** (instance-bound), each serving distinct purposes.
- **Purpose**: Nesting is ideal for **composition**â€”a strong "whole-part" relationship (e.g., `Car` and `Engine`)â€”where the partâ€™s existence depends on the whole.
- **Compilation**: Nested classes generate separate `.class` files: `Outer.class` for the outer class and `Outer$Nested.class` for the nested class, reflecting their nested nature.
- **Key Insight**: Nested classes deepen encapsulation and organization, aligning with OOPâ€™s modular design goals.

### 2.2 Implementing Nested Classes
- **Tools**: Java supports nested classes via class declarations within another class, with or without the `static` modifier.
- **Example: Basic Nested Class**:
  ```java
  class Outer {
      private int data = 99;  // Private outer data

      class Inner {  // Non-static inner class
          void message() {
              System.out.println("Data of outer class: " + data);  // Accesses outer private data
          }
      }

      void disp() {  // Outer method
          System.out.println("I am outer class method");
          Inner in = new Inner();  // Instantiate inner within method
          in.message();           // Call inner method
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Outer out = new Outer();
          out.disp();  // Output: I am outer class method / Data of outer class: 99

          // Alternative instantiation
          Outer.Inner in = out.new Inner();
          in.message();  // Output: Data of outer class: 99
      }
  }
  ```
- **How It Works**: `Outer` contains `Inner`, which accesses `data`. Two instantiation methods are shown: within a method (`disp`) and directly via `out.new Inner()`.

### 2.3 Advanced Features

#### 2.3.1 Types of Nested Classes
- **Definition**: *Types of Nested Classes* categorize how classes are nested in Java:
  - **Static Nested Classes**: Marked with `static`, independent of outer instances.
  - **Inner Classes**: Non-static, tied to an outer instance, further divided into member, local, and anonymous types.
- **Table**:
  | Type            | Description                           | Static? | Example                |
  |-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------|------------------------|
  | Static Nested   | Independent of outer instance         | Yes     | `static class Nested`  |
  | Inner (Member)  | Tied to outer instance, class member  | No      | `class Inner`          |
  | Inner (Local)   | Defined in a method, named            | No      | `class B` in method    |
  | Inner (Anonymous) | Defined in a method, no name        | No      | `new SuperType() {}`   |

#### 2.3.2 Static Nested Classes
- **Definition**: *Static Nested Classes* are nested classes marked with the `static` keyword, behaving like static members of the outer classâ€”independent of outer instances.
- **Key Point**: Can access only static members of the outer class.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class Outer {
      private static int staticData = 100;

      static class Nested {
          void display() {
              System.out.println("Static data: " + staticData);
          }
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Outer.Nested nested = new Outer.Nested();
          nested.display();  // Output: Static data: 100
      }
  }
  ```

#### 2.3.3 Inner Classes
- **Definition**: *Inner Classes* are non-static nested classes tied to an instance of the outer class, unable to contain static members due to their instance-bound nature.
- **Key Point**: Access all outer class members, even private ones.

#### 2.3.4 Member Inner Classes
- **Definition**: *Member Inner Classes* are inner classes defined directly within the outer class, acting like instance members.
- **Instantiation**: Requires an outer instance (e.g., `outer.new Inner()`).
- **Example**: See "Implementing Abstraction" aboveâ€”`Inner` accesses `data`.

#### 2.3.5 Local Inner Classes
- **Definition**: *Local Inner Classes* are inner classes defined within a method, with a name, scoped to that method.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class Outer {
      void method() {
          class Local {
              void msg() { System.out.println("Local class in method"); }
          }
          Local local = new Local();
          local.msg();  // Output: Local class in method
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          new Outer().method();
      }
  }
  ```

#### 2.3.6 Anonymous Inner Classes
- **Definition**: *Anonymous Inner Classes* are local inner classes without a name, defined and instantiated inline within a method, often using a supertype (class/interface).
- **Example**:
  ```java
  class Outer {
      void perform() {
          Runnable r = new Runnable() {  // Anonymous class implementing Runnable
              public void run() { System.out.println("Running anonymously"); }
          };
          r.run();  // Output: Running anonymously
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          new Outer().perform();
      }
  }
  ```
- **Note**: Covered in-depth in a later session, but shown here for completeness.

#### 2.3.7 Access Modifiers for Nested Classes
- **Definition**: *Access Modifiers* control visibility of nested classes, enhancing encapsulation.
- **Options**: 
  - Outer: `public`, `default`, `final`, `abstract`, `strictfp`.
  - Inner: `public`, `private`, `protected`, `default`.
- **Table**:
  | Modifier   | Outer Class | Inner Class | Example                  |
  |------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
  | `public`   | Yes         | Yes         | `public class Inner`     |
  | `private`  | No          | Yes         | `private class Inner`    |
  | `protected`| No          | Yes         | `protected class Inner`  |
  | `default`  | Yes         | Yes         | `class Inner`            |

## 3. Practical Guidance

### 3.1 Best Practices
- Use nested classes for **logical grouping** (e.g., `Car` and `Engine`).
- Choose **static nested classes** for standalone utilities tied to the outer class.
- Use **inner classes** for instance-dependent logic.
- Prefer **member inner classes** for direct outer class integration.
- Opt for **local inner classes** for method-specific helpers.
- Leverage **anonymous inner classes** for quick, one-off implementations.
- Apply `private` or `protected` to inner classes for encapsulation.
- Avoid static members in inner classesâ€”use static nested classes instead.

### 3.2 Common Pitfalls
- Misusing inner classes where static nested classes suffice.
- Forgetting to instantiate the outer class before inner class creation.
- Attempting static members in inner classes (not allowed).
- Overcomplicating with unnecessary nestingâ€”keep it purposeful.
- Using `public` inner classes excessively, reducing encapsulation.
- Confusing local and anonymous class scopes.

### 3.3 Practice Exercises
1. Create an `Outer` class with a `private int value` and a `public Inner` class printing `value`.
2. Add a `StaticNested` class accessing a static outer field.
3. Define a method in `Outer` with a `Local` class displaying a local variable.
4. Implement an anonymous inner class in a method using `Runnable`.
5. Test instantiation of all types with appropriate access modifiers.

### 4.1 Static Nested Classes vs. Inner Classes
| **Aspect**            | **Static Nested Classes**               | **Inner Classes**                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Static**            | Yes, independent of instance           | No, tied to instance              |
| **Access**            | Static outer members only              | All outer members, even private   |
| **Instantiation**     | `Outer.Nested n = new Outer.Nested()`  | `Outer.Inner i = out.new Inner()` |
| **Static Members**    | Allowed                                | Not allowed                       |
| **Example**           | Utility tied to outer class            | Instance-specific helper          |
